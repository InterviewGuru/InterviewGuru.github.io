    {
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "question": "What is React?",
      "answer": "React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, developed by Facebook. It allows developers to create reusable UI components."
    },
    {
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "question": "What are the key features of React?",
      "answer": "Virtual DOM, JSX (JavaScript XML) syntax, Components, One-way data flow, and the use of libraries like Redux for state management."
    },
    {
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "question": "What is the difference between props and state in React?",
      "answer": "Props (short for properties) are parameters that are passed into React components. They allow data to be passed from a parent component to a child component. State is an object that represents the parts of a component that can change over time. It's managed internally by the component and can be updated using the setState() method."
    },
    {
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "question": "What are React Hooks?",
      "answer": "React Hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features without writing a class component. They allow you to reuse stateful logic across multiple components."
    },
    {
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "question": "What is the significance of useEffect() in React?",
      "answer": "useEffect() is a built-in React Hook that allows you to perform side effects in function components. It's similar to componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount lifecycle methods combined in class components."
    },
    {
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "question": "What is React Router?",
      "answer": "React Router is a popular routing library for React applications. It allows you to declare routes in your application and handle navigation between different components."
    },
    {
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "question": "What is JSX?",
      "answer": "JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows mixing HTML with JavaScript code. It allows developers to write HTML-like code within their JavaScript files."
    },
    {
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "question": "What are React components?",
      "answer": "React components are the building blocks of React applications. They are reusable and encapsulate both the UI and the logic required to render that UI."
    },
    {
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "question": "What is Redux?",
      "answer": "Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. It helps you manage the state of your application in a predictable way and makes it easier to debug and test your code."
    },
    {
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "question": "What are controlled components in React?",
      "answer": "Controlled components are React components that are controlled by React state. They receive their current value through props and notify changes through callbacks like onChange."
    },
    {
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "question": "What are higher-order components (HOC) in React?",
      "answer": "Higher-order components are functions that take a component and return a new component with additional functionality. They allow you to reuse code, share state, and manipulate the rendering of components."
    },
    {
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "question": "What is the purpose of key prop in React lists?",
      "answer": "The key prop is a special attribute used by React to identify which items have changed, been added, or been removed from a list. It helps React efficiently update the UI when lists are modified."
    },
    {
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "question": "What is the Virtual DOM in React?",
      "answer": "The Virtual DOM is a lightweight representation of the actual DOM in memory. React uses it to perform efficient updates to the actual DOM by minimizing the number of DOM manipulations."
    },
    {
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "question": "What is the purpose of ReactDOM.render() method in React?",
      "answer": "ReactDOM.render() is a method used to render React elements into the DOM. It takes two arguments: a React element and a DOM container where the element will be rendered."
    },
    {
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "question": "What is the Context API in React?",
      "answer": "The Context API is a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. It provides a way to share values like themes, user authentication, or preferred language across the entire application."
